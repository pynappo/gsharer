gsharer is an extensible file uploader with support for Lua scripting/configuration.

# Supported destinations

currently it's just litterbox and catbox

# How to use

TODO

# TODO stuff

- [ ] support authenticating with oauth like sharex does
- [ ] support requiring sharex files as if they were lua
- [ ] probably link luajit or higher instead of 5.1

# Thanks to:

https://github.com/aarzilli/golua for providing lua support
https://github.com/urfave/cli for the cli framework

# Plans for fun:

See how rewriting in another language (zig, rust) feels.
